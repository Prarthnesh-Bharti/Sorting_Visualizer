# Sorting Visualizer

We have learnt many sorting algorithms. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. 

So decided to Create a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.

## Features

- Colored representation of step being executed. 
  - Blue: Default 
  - Yellow : Being compared 
  - Red : Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 
  - Green : In correct position
- Three Controls for visualizations : 
  - Generation of new data array (Randomly generate new array).
  - Set size of data array in range certain range.
  - Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)  



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
